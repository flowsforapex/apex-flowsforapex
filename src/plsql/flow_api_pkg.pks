Procedure flow_reserve_step
Reservation is a light-weight process for a user to indicate to other users that he/she intends to work on 
the current task in order to prevent multiple users working on the same task at the same time.
A reservation is typically made by supplying the reserving user's username as the p_reservation parameter 
(although an application could come up with some other scheme for the reservation parameter, and so it is not 
restricted to being a userid).  Other users will be able to see that a reservation has been placed on a step.
Reservations are purely a signalling mechanism;  no enforcement is taken in the engine 
to restrict other users from undertaking a task reserved by somebody.
A reservation can be released using the flow_release_step procedure.
A reservation applies only to the current task waiting to be completed.  Once the task is completed, there is 
no reservation carried forward onto future tasks in the process.
Reservation is not an authorization control, and is not security relevant / enforcing in the engine.

work on the task, which is used to distinguish betweeen time waiting for the task to get worked on and the time that it is actually 
being worked on. Flow_start_step does not perform any functional role in processing a flow instance, and is optional - but it 
just helps gather process performance statistics that distinguish queing time from processing time.  
Despite being optional, a well formed, best-practice application will use this call so that process statistics can be captured.
